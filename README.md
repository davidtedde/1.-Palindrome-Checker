<h1>Palindrome checker from FreeCodeCamp</h1>
<p>This repository contains the Palindrome Checker project, based on the first of five projects from the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</a> by FreeCodeCamp.</p>
<p>While adhering to the base requirements, Iâ€™ve added some additional features, enhancing it to fit my personal learning journey. </p>
